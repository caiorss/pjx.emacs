* Emacs-project Manager - pjx 
** Overview 

IDEA: Create an Emacs package to handle software projects. 

Wishlist / Requirements:

 - File template selection per lanaguage
 - Project template selection 
 - Project metadata search
 - Integrate to build system
 - Provide higher order functions
 - Close and Open a set of files

Features: 

 - [X] switch between project buffers

 - [ ] switch between project dired buffers

 - [ ] switch between project buffers associated to files

 - [ ] Command to close all buffers not related to current project

 - [ ] Python backend for metadata

 - [X] find files in project sub-directories

 - [X] find files in project sub-directories matching a regex

 - [X] find files in project sub-directories with a given extension

 - [X] close all project files

 - [X] open a project in a new frame dedicated to the project. The
   commands C-x right (M-x next-buffer) and C-x left (M-x
   previous-buffer) switches only between project buffer files.

 - [X] Run compilation commands and make specific commands at project root
   directory.

Todolist: 

 - [X] Add package header 

 - [ ] Add documentation

 - [X] Add summary

 - [ ] Add development documentation and notes.

 - [ ] Add examples 

 - [ ] Add gifs
